## Project description

Website created as part of the Applied Networking Final Project. The website contains all of the labs created throughout the semester. Labs consisted of performing various HTML, PHP, and CSS tasks. These tasks were meant to develop the studentâ€™s website development skills.

## How to compile / run the program

The Website is currently running on an Apache server. To install an Apache server please follow [this](https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/tools/xampp-tutorial-create-your-own-local-test-server/) guide on how to install and setup XAMMP and your own Apache server.

Once you have downloaded and setup your apache server, you may clone the repository and copy it to your Xampp directory (C:\xampp). Make sure to replace the default htdocs files with the one provided in my repository. After the source code is in your htdocs, you must start your Apache server. To do this type 'Xampp control panel" in your search bar and opent the Xampp Control Panel application. Once it has loaded, look for the Apache service and press the start button. Now your Apache server should be running.

To view the website, open the internet browser of your choice and enter "localhost" in the browser's address bar. You should now be able to see the website.

## UI Design

Once logged into the website, the homepage (See Figure 1) provides a welcome message with some information about me. It also provides a horizontal navagation bar to view the various labs created throughout the semester. If you scroll down on the homepage you will be able to learn about me and my family (See Figure 2). At the bottom of the homepage you will see another horizontal navigation bar that lets you find out more about my family, my family picture (My Gallery), and my home videos (See Figure 2).

By clicking on "My Family" you will be able to see a picture of my wonderful family and you can learn more about us (See Figure 3). If you select the "My Gallery" link, you will be greeted with more pictures of my family and I (See Figure 4). Lastly, you can click on the "My Home Videos" link and you will be greeted with a video of my son when he was learning how to walk (See Figure 5). Notice that the bottom navigational bar changes based on the page that you are on (See Figures 2-4).

## 3. Additional Considerations

This project was built early 2019 and some labs were cancelled due to COVID 19 restrictions.
