## Project description

This script created in Perl is a Guessing Game where the user attempts to guess a number. The script generates a random positive number from a range of values determined by the user. The user will be given an option to quit the game after the first failed guess and after every third failed guessing attempt. If the user decides to quit the game without correctly guessing the number, the correct number will be printed to the screen before exiting the game.

## How to compile / run the program

Download and install perl on your system. Then you must find the file on your terminal. After locating the file enter the following:

```
perl projectOne.pl
```

## UI Design

This script uses a command line interface. Users are prompted to enter a number that corresponds with an available selection. All available options are displayed to the user at all times. This was done in order to prevent users from having to memorize commands in order to use the application.
