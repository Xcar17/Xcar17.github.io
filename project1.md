## Project description

This program is designed to interact with customers to produce a movie ticket. The features of this program allows customers to choose their desired film, time of day, and payment option. Once selections are made the customer will be able to purchase and print their ticket. Aditionally, the program will allow an employee with designated rights to manage the available movies, times, seating, and ticket prices. 

## How to compiles / run the program

Download file and run MyDriver.java file on NetBeans application.

## UI Design

This Movie Ticket Booking application uses a command line user interface. Users are prompted to enter a number that corresponds with an available selection. All available options are displayed to the user at all times. This was done in order to prevent users from having to memorize commands in order to use the application.
