## Project description

This program is designed to interact with customers to produce a movie ticket. The features of this program allows customers to choose their desired film, time of day, and payment option. Once selections are made the customer will be able to purchase and print their ticket. Aditionally, the program will allow an employee with designated rights to manage the available movies, times, seating, and ticket prices. 

## How to compiles / run the program

In order to run this program you need to install a Java Development Kit (JDK) which includes the Java runtime needed to run this application. You may download a Java JDK by following [this link](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/). After you download the Java JDK, please visit [this link](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/windows/jdk-installation-windows.html) for instructions on how to install the JDK and how to setup your Java enviroment. The instructions also include a very helpful troubleshooting guide. After the Java JDK is installed and setup you can download the TicketBookingSystem directory from the repository. You are now ready to compile and run the program.

- In order to compile the program run the Command Prompt and open the "src" directory inside of the "TicketBookingSystem" directory. Ex. If your TicketBookingSystem directory is in the Downloads directory the command will look like this "cd Downloads/TicketBookingSystem/src". 
- Once you are in the "src" directory, enter "javac csu/csci325/MyDriver.java" to compile the program.
- Once the program has been compiled you may enter "java csu.csci325.MyDriver" to run the program.

## UI Design

This Movie Ticket Booking application uses a command line user interface. Users are prompted to enter a number that corresponds with an available selection. All available options are displayed to the user at all times. This was done in order to prevent users from having to memorize commands in order to use the application.
